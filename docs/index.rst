Welcome to bayesianbandits's documentation!
===========================================

`bayesianbandits` is a Python package for Bayesian bandits. It provides a
simple, Pythonic interface to implement and different algorithms to solve multi-armed
bandit problems. To facilitate this, it provides a number of different Bayesian and 
recursive Bayesian estimators to represent the knowledge of the reward distribution
of each arm.

This library is still under development and the API is subject to change. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue
on the project page on GitHub or contact me at <rishi@kulkarni.science>.
